# House Price Prediction

## Overview

The House Price Prediction project aims to predict house prices based on various features using a linear regression model. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building to provide accurate price predictions.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Cleans and preprocesses raw housing data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes data to understand patterns, correlations, and distributions.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Converts categorical variables into a numerical format to be used in the model.
- **Model Building**: Utilizes a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on processed features.

## How It Works

1. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the housing dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset to uncover insights and relationships between features.
3. **Feature Encoding**: Apply one-hot encoding to convert categorical features into numerical format.
4. **Model Training**: Train a Linear Regression model on the processed dataset to predict house prices.

## Requirements

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
